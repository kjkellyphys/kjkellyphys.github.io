A complete, up-to-date list of my publications is available on my [INSPIREHEP page](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/K.J.Kelly.1) or can be found in the PDF version of [my CV](https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_CV.pdf). Below are a few recent publications with some background information about the studies involved

## Current and Future Neutrino Oscillation Constraints on Leptonic Unitarity
The vast majority of the time when neutrino physicists study neutrino oscillations, they make one key assumption, that the matrix that determines how neutrinos mix is [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix). This matrix is 3x3 and has complex entries, and unitarity places a constraints on the values that enter the matrix (the unitary 3x3 matrix is usually described as the [PMNS matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontecorvo%E2%80%93Maki%E2%80%93Nakagawa%E2%80%93Sakata_matrix) of neutrino oscillations).

Recently, I teamed up with Sebastian Ellis and Shirley Li to ask the question "how well do we currently know that this mixing matrix is unitary?" along with "what will future data from the planned, upcoming neutrino experiments add to this picture?" The results of asking these questions are contained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01088). We found that current unitarity constraints are at the level of 30% and that next-generation experiments ([IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/), [DUNE](https://www.dunescience.org/), [T2HK](https://www.hyperk.org/), and [JUNO](http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/)) will be able to improve these to the 10% level. If their combination finds any deviations from unitarity, it is a hint that our three-neutrino-mixing picture is incomplete and new physics is required!
