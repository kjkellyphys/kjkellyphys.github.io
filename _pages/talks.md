Over the last several years, I've given a wide variety of seminars and conference talks in different contexts. I've also been fortunate enough to speak to groups of high-school students, undergraduate students, [brewery patrons](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/programs/astronomy-on-tap/), and life-long learners in order to inspire them about particle physics and neutrinos. An example of a recent public lecture I gave on neutrinos and cosmology can be found [here](https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_Neutrinos.pdf).

Given the virtual nature of the [Neutrino 2020](https://conferences.fnal.gov/nu2020/) conference, the typical conference poster session had to be re-imagined. I presented a poster (which you can find the PDF of [here](https://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/nu2020postersession/pdf/posterPDF-371.pdf)) that was distributed with an associated two minute video. That video can be seen on [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egAqQXu522Y), and explains some of the work associated with the poster.

I also enjoy giving more technical seminars about my research work. A full list of the seminars I have given (as well as conference talks) is available on [my CV](https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_CV.pdf). One recent talk that I gave was about searches for dark matter at the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment's near detector. The slides from that talk can be found at [this link](https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_DUNE_DM.pdf).
