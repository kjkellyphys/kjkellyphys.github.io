Over the last several years, I've given a wide variety of seminars and conference talks in different contexts. I've also been fortunate enough to speak to groups of high-school students, undergraduate students, <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/programs/astronomy-on-tap/" target="_blank">brewery patrons</a>, and life-long learners in order to inspire them about particle physics and neutrinos. An example of a recent public lecture I gave on neutrinos and cosmology can be found <a href="https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_Neutrinos.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

Given the virtual nature of the <a href="https://conferences.fnal.gov/nu2020/" target="_blank">Neutrino 2020</a> conference, the typical conference poster session had to be re-imagined. I presented a poster (which you can find the PDF of <a href="https://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/nu2020postersession/pdf/posterPDF-371.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) that was distributed with an associated two minute video. That video can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egAqQXu522Y" target="_blank">YouTube here</a>, and explains some of the work associated with the poster.

I also enjoy giving more technical seminars about my research work. A full list of the seminars I have given (as well as conference talks) is available on <a href="https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a>. One recent talk that I gave was about searches for dark matter at the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment's near detector. The slides from that talk can be found at <a href="https://kjkellyphys.github.io/files/KJK_DUNE_DM.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a>.
